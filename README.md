# this is your very own starter battlesnake!!!
## below is a set of instructions about your battlesnake
## and how it works!

1. you should not need to edit anything in main.py. 

2. you use snake_info.json to customize your snakes color, head and tail.  That is all.

3. gameobjects.py can be ignored(i think).

4. snakelogic.py is where you put all the code that makes your snake do whatever you code it to do.
